# ⚡ Welcome to my Digital Workspace! 

Hi! I'm **Aryan**, a Computer Science student at Graphic Era Hill University. I don't just write code; I build solutions that make sense (and hopefully make lives easier). 

Currently, I'm deep-diving into **Full Stack Development** and **Machine Learning**, while navigating my way through a B.Tech degree.

### 🛠️ What’s on my desk right now?

* **Building:** A Full Stack Online Examination System (making testing less stressful, one line at a time).
* **Optimizing:** Working on a Warehouse & Inventory system to solve real-world logistics headaches.
* **Learning:** Currently exploring the depths of Oracle Cloud (OCI) and AI.
* **Goal:** Gearing up for the Amazon SDE Internship drive! 🚀
